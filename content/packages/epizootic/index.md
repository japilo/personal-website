This extension of the pattern-oriented modeling framework of the poems package
provides a collection of modules and functions customized for modeling disease transmission on a population scale in a spatiotemporally explicit manner. This includes seasonal time steps, dispersal functions that track disease state of dispersers, results objects that store disease states, and a population simulator that includes disease dynamics.

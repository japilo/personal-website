The poems package provides a framework of interoperable *R6* (Chang,
2020) classes for building ensembles of viable models via the
pattern-oriented modeling (POM) approach (Grimm et al., 2005). The
package includes classes for encapsulating and generating model
parameters, and managing the POM workflow. The workflow includes:

1.  Model setup including generated spatial layers and demographic
    population model parameters.
2.  Generating model parameters via Latin hypercube sampling (Iman &
    Conover, 1980).
3.  Running multiple sampled model simulations.
4.  Collating summary results metrics via user-defined functions.
5.  Validating and selecting an ensemble of models that best match known
    patterns.

By default, model validation and selection utilizes an approximate
Bayesian computation (ABC) approach (Beaumont et al., 2002) using the
*abc* package (Csillery et al., 2015). However, alternative user-defined
functionality could be employed.

The package includes a spatially explicit demographic population model
simulation engine, which incorporates default functionality for density
dependence, correlated environmental stochasticity, stage-based
transitions, and distance-based dispersal. The user may customize the
simulator by defining functionality for trans-locations, harvesting,
mortality, and other processes, as well as defining the sequence order
for the simulator processes. The framework could also be adapted for use
with other model simulators by utilizing its extendable (inheritable)
base classes.

I start every new research project the same way: by sketching it out with pencil and paper over as many sheets of paper as I need.

Outlines with headings and subheadings are great, and I always produce those for research projects as well, but the sketches have to come first. I need the expansiveness to spin off my ideas in every direction before I subject them to the linearity and order of an outline.

There are many mind-mapping programs available to accomplish this, such as [Scapple][1] and [Miro][2]. The problem with any software, though, is that what you can do with it is limited by the developers' vision of what mind-mapping is meant to be. If your preferred method breaks outside the bounds of what the software is made to do, then you're inherently constrained. I want my brainstorming to be unconstrained.

Of course, paper has its constraints, too. It's not searchable or linkable to other documents. But once I take a picture of my sketches with my phone and digitize it, the text becomes searchable, and I can tag it and link it with other documents. Personally, I use Microsoft OneNote to organize my many pictures of pen-and-paper sketches.

Personally, I benefit from kinesthetic memory as well, so I'm more likely to remember the ideas I came up with if I physically sketched them out. The hands recall.

It's not for everyone, but for me, nothing beats a pencil and a pad of blank A3 paper for starting out on a new big idea.
